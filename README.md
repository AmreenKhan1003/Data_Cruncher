# Data_Cruncher

CLI application which encodes and decodes the data through the Huffman coding algorithm. It compresses and decompresses text files. Users can provide the input file that they want to compress and the application will generate an encoded file which is considered as a compressed file that can be used further for decompression. The user can again provide the encoded file and the application can decode it by generating a decoded file which is the same as the actual input file this process is nothing but decompression.

# Procedure:

***Encoding***
- Provide input.txt file, actual string file.
- Perform encoding using the Huffman Coding algorithm.
- Generates an encoded.txt file containing 0's and 1's.

***Decoding***
- Provide encoded.txt file
- Perform decoding using the Huffman Coding algorithm.
- Generates a decoded.txt file which is the same as the input.txt file.

# Output:
- output.txt (containing 0's and 1's)
- decoded.txt (same as input file)
